Continued JavaScript basics on Udemy. Control Flow, Functions, Arrays. Did some exercises along the way.

### R1D5-6 - Dec 7-8, 2018

### R1D7 - Dec 9, 2018
Fixed the scrolling on my portfolio page by making the navbars opaque. I might encounter a better solution as I progress on my learning. Also, started learning about DOM Manipulation.

### R1D8 - Dec 10, 2018
Continued learning about DOM Manipulation (Events specifically). 

### R1D9 - Dec 11, 2018
Built a Color Guesser mini-app by coding along with Colt's lecture. I coded along but I'm completely satisfied that I understood every little thing about it. Stressful week ahead with finals coming up but still have to do at least 1hr of code per day.
