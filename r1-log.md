## Log

### R1D1 - Dec 3, 2018
I left the habit and now restarting once again. Trial #2. Been re-working my personal website and following a course on Udemy. Here's to starting over again.

### R1D2 - Dec 4, 2018
Worked a little bit on Applied Visual Design on FCC.

### R1D3 - Dec 5, 2018
Continued working on Applied Visual CSS on FCC and also started JavaScript section on my Udemy course (WDB by Colt Steele). Exciting stuff ahead!

### R1D4 - Dec 6, 2018
Continued JavaScript basics on Udemy. Control Flow, Functions, Arrays. Did some exercises along the way.

### R1D5-6 - Dec 7-8, 2018
Learned JS Objects and worked on portfolio page of my personal website. Need to fix it so content doesn't go under the navbar when scrolling down.

### R1D7 - Dec 9, 2018
Fixed the scrolling on my portfolio page by making the navbars opaque. I might encounter a better solution as I progress on my learning. Also, started learning about DOM Manipulation.

### R1D8 - Dec 10, 2018
Continued learning about DOM Manipulation (Events specifically). 

### R1D9 - Dec 11, 2018
Built a Color Guesser mini-app by coding along with Colt's lecture. I coded along but I'm completely satisfied that I understood every little thing about it. Stressful week ahead with finals coming up but still have to do at least 1hr of code per day.

### R1D10 - Dec 16, 2018
Finals week kind of wrecked me and I've been reading and going through some of the course but there wasn't significant progress enough to document it. Anyways, started learning jQuery today. The goal is to finish going through the jQuery section and start the Todo list project tomorrow.

### R1D11 - Dec 17, 2018
Crushed my goals today!
Finished jQuery section of the course. ✔️
Did the Todo List App (coded the functions by myself, then followed the design/layout from Colt). ✔️
Did some planning for the layout of my personal project. ✔️

### R1D12 - Dec 18, 2018
Not very productive today. I was out the entire day but managed to start my project. Ran into a little trouble on how to center the navbar-brand but found a way.

### R1D13 - Dec 19, 2018
Worked on my project's home page. I still take a lot of time figuring out how to make my desired layout work, which means I need a lot more practice. I'm pretty excited on how it's coming along though. I've decided to dedicate some time for this project everyday while still going through some of the lectures. 

### R1D14 - Dec 20,2018
Kept working on my project's home page. Also  watched some css layout tutorials.

### R1D15 - Dec 22, 2018
Almost done with my personal project's home page. Did some readings about React-Native for a project with some of my school friends. I better learn JavaScript some more.

### R1D16 - Dec 24, 2018
Set up environment on vagrant for web/mobile app group project while documenting the setup process. Also trying to setup React Native environment but ran out of disk space for Android Studio on the VM. Will try to figure out tomorrow. MERRY CHRISTMAS EVE! 

### R1D17 - Dec 25, 2018
Still struggling on increasing disk size of my VM. I also realized my dual booted Ubuntu is also running low on disk space. Need to get this sorted before I resume my project. 

### R1D18-20 - Dec 26-28, 2018
Had to do a fresh install of Ubuntu and I chose to totally ditch Windows (I had it dualbooted). Got busy setting up everything again so haven't had much done related to actual projects the last few days.

### R1D21 - Dec 29, 2018
I thought I finished setting up my react-native environment but when I tried to do "react-native run-android", the emulator from android studio isn't working. It's so frustrating because I have to do everything on a VM. (The reason I have to do it in VM is because my group is using vagrant so that we all have the same environment.) Now, I'll have to figure out how to run a Virtual Device on a VM (it says I dont have VT-X/SVM) or how to access a phone connected on a VM.
